This repository contains (rubik)Cube programs as found on [God's Number is 20](https://cube20.org/src/)
This is a study for cube scrambling, less focused on solving; there are plenty of solvers out there.
Also a set of programs used for solving the cube, the Coset Solver and Two-Phase Solver are used for validation.

I've added a couple of changes to the Makefile for workspace cleanup and better git workflow.
